# MCBR

MCBR is a Minecraft battle royale server plugin of (currently) up to 7 custom-coded kits and old-school soup PvP.

## How to Play

If you have loaded up MCBR correctly, you should see a list of classes you can pick from after typing in "/kits"

To select a kit, type "/kit <KIT_NAME>"

When the warm-up timer ends, you will spawn with your kit items (passive or physical). 
You will then have another 5 minutes to gather up materials before the invincibility time period ends.
From there, it's a timed battle to the death until there is only one remaining.

## Soup

Like PvP of old, there will be soup-based PvP. This means that right-clicking mushroom soup will heal 3.5 hearts instantly. To craft mushroom soup, you will need red and brown mushrooms + a bowl

## Compass

Everyone spawns with a compass that guides you to the closest player to you when right-clicked.

## Kits

Every kit is different but gives you a unique advantage in some way. 2 examples below:

* The Thor kit spawns you in with a magical axe that upon right clicking a block, sends lightning down, damaging anyone on that block, destroys it and sets it on fire. You are passively immune to fire. There is a cooldown of 5 seconds before re-use.

* The Flash kit gives you the ability to move really fast for 5 seconds (1 minute cooldown), leaving a trail of fire behind you.
